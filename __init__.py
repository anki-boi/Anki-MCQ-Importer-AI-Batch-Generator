# True Anki MCQ Importer - AI Batch Generator (v4.1 - Config-Based Prompts)
# Changes from v4.0:
# - Prompts now live exclusively in config.json (survive addon updates)
# - migrate_prompts_to_config() seeds config on first run, never overwrites after
# - "New Blank Profile" button with format selector for fully custom prompts
# - Duplicate still works for "copy & tweak" workflow
# - _SEED_* strings in Python are only used once at first run, then ignored

_SEED_MCQ_PROMPT = """***

### ** PROMPT FOR CSV CREATION**

**Objective:**
Create a targeted yet comprehensive set of multiple-choice questions (MCQs) covering the most high-yield aspects of the provided text. The goal is to achieve maximum coverage with minimum redundancy. Prioritize depth, uniqueness, and comprehension, while ensuring questions are challenging and well-formatted.

**Key Instructions:**

**1. Coverage & Priority:**
- Generate questions based on the following priority hierarchy:
    1.  Classification
    2.  Specific Drug/Substance Names
    3.  Mechanism of Action (MoA)
    4.  Therapeutic Uses
    5.  Adverse Effects
    6.  Common Names / Nicknames
    7.  Constituents
- Create questions about other unique, testable facts found in the text, even if they don't fit the categories above.
- Crucially, keep the question set lean. For reciprocal facts (e.g., 'What is the application of Method X?' vs. 'What is the method for Application Y?'), always prioritize the version that asks for the specific detail (the application, substance, or description) when given the broader category (the method or class). For example, prefer asking "Vitamins assayed by Fluorometry include:" over asking "The method used to assay Vitamins B1 and B2 is:". The goal is to test the recall of specific details associated with a known category.
- True or false questions are strictly forbidden.
- The best version of a redundant question is one that asks for the name of a specific species.
- Ignore exercises and sample problems in the source text.

**2. Distractor Quality & Choice Parity (CRITICAL):**
- **Contextual Relevance:** Incorrect options (distractors) MUST be contextually relevant. They should be from the same general category as the correct answer to test for nuanced understanding (e.g., a question about a specific antibiotic should use other antibiotics as distractors).
- **Structural & Length Parity:** All options in the `Multiple Choice` column should be of **similar length and grammatical structure**. Avoid making the correct answer noticeably longer or more detailed than the distractors.
- **Avoid Parenthetical Giveaways:** If a correct answer requires a clarification in parentheses (e.g., `Drug X (Class Y)`), add plausible, contextually relevant clarifications in the same format to the distractors as well. EXTREMELY EXTREMELY IMPORTANT OR ELSE CUTE KITTENS WILL DIE.
- **The goal is to make the correct answer indistinguishable from the distractors based on formatting or length alone.**

**3. Question & Answer Phrasing:**
- Avoid phrases like "According to the text," "from the provided text," etc.
- Avoid ambiguous pronouns such as "this," "that," or "it."
- Be concise in the question column unless more detail is needed to avoid ambiguity.
- Do not use "What," "Which," "Where," "How," or "Why." Follow the example statement-like formatting.
- In the `Question` and `Extra` columns, never refer to images or the text itself.
- **Mnemonic Isolation:** Strictly isolate mnemonics to the `Extra` column. The `Question`, `Multiple Choice`, and `Correct Answers` columns must **not** contain any hints, wordplay, or direct phrasing from the mnemonic.

**4. AI Knowledge & Corrections:**
- Stay within the provided text for creating questions and answers, but you are encouraged to use your broader knowledge to enrich the `Extra` column.
- Add a `Rationale:` to the `Extra` column whenever possible to provide context.
- If you identify a factual error in the source text, create the question using the corrected information. In the `Extra` column, add a note detailing the correction (e.g., `Note: Source text stated [incorrect fact], which has been corrected to [correct fact].`).

**5. Formatting & Structure:**
- Use pipes `|` as separators for the CSV columns.
- Skip the `Question|Multiple Choice|Correct Answers|Extra` headers.
- Use HTML line breaks `<br>` to separate items in the `Multiple Choice` and `Correct Answers` columns. **This is the only HTML tag permitted in these two columns.**
- The number of multiple choice options should always be greater than the number of correct answers. Create at the very least 6 choices.
- HTML tags like `<b>`, `<i>`, and `<u>` are **only permitted** in the `Question` and `Extra` columns. Use them to emphasize key words in the `Question` column and for formatting in the `Extra` column. Avoid overlapping HTML tags.
- Image tags / references (if provided) are to be added to the end of their respective cards at the bottom of the Extra Column

**6. Example (Reflecting All Final Rules):**

```
Subtopic Name | Question|Multiple Choice|Correct Answers|Extra
Anti-Diabetes|Classes of drugs for <b>diabetes mellitus</b>:|Insulin secretagogues<br>Biguanides<br>Thiazolidinediones<br>Alpha-glucosidase inhibitors<br>Incretin-based drugs<br>SGLT2 Inhibitors<br>Amylin Analogues<br>Alkaloids<br>Carbamates|Insulin secretagogues<br>Biguanides<br>Thiazolidinediones<br>Alpha-glucosidase inhibitors<br>Incretin-based drugs<br>SGLT2 Inhibitors<br>Amylin Analogues|Rationale: Except for insulin injections, which are the primary treatment for Type 1 DM but also used in Type 2, the other listed oral hypoglycemic agents are used for Type 2 DM.<br><br>Mnemonic: <b>I</b>n <b>B</b>right <b>T</b>imes, <b>A</b>ll <b>I</b>ndividuals <b>S</b>hine <b>A</b>gain.
Anti-Diabetes|Mechanism of action of <b>Insulin Secretagogues</b>:|Blockade of ATP-sensitive K+ channels<br>Activation of AMP-activated protein kinase<br>Agonism of PPAR-γ receptors<br>Inhibition of alpha-glucosidase enzymes<br>Stimulation of glucagon-like peptide-1<br>Inhibition of sodium-glucose cotransporter 2|Blockade of ATP-sensitive K+ channels|Rationale: Blocking ATP-sensitive K+ channels leads to membrane depolarization, which opens voltage-gated Ca2+ channels. The subsequent influx of calcium triggers the exocytosis of insulin-containing granules from the β-cells.<br><br>Mnemonic: <i>Secret</i>-<b>B</b>K+ blockers
Anti-Diabetes|Biguanide drug largely withdrawn from the market due to a high risk of fatal <b>lactic acidosis</b>:|Phenformin<br>Metformin<br>Buformin<br>Empagliflozin<br>Acarbose<br>Pioglitazone|Phenformin|Rationale: Phenformin carries a significantly higher risk of causing lactic acidosis compared to metformin because of its chemical structure, which leads to greater inhibition of mitochondrial respiration.
Tannins|Plant sources rich in <b>tannins</b>:|Psidium guajava (Guava)<br>Hamamelis virginiana (Witch Hazel)<br>Quercus infectoria (Oak galls)<br>Syzygium cumini (Java plum)<br>Ginkgo biloba (Ginkgo)<br>Panax ginseng (Ginseng)|Psidium guajava (Guava)<br>Hamamelis virginiana (Witch Hazel)<br>Quercus infectoria (Oak galls)<br>Syzygium cumini (Java plum)|Rationale: The listed plants are notable for their high tannin content. Distractors like Ginkgo and Ginseng are known for other active compounds (ginkgolides, ginsenosides).
Sesame oil|The primary antioxidant lignan constituents of <b>Sesamum indicum</b>:|Sesamol<br>Sesamolin<br>Gossypol<br>Ricin<br>Theobromine<br>Anethole|Sesamol<br>Sesamolin|Rationale: Sesamol and sesamolin are powerful antioxidants in sesame oil. The distractors are toxic or primary constituents of other plants: Gossypol (cottonseed), Ricin (castor bean), Theobromine (cacao), and Anethole (anise).
Zoonotic Diseases|Causative organisms of <b>Rat-bite fever</b>:|Streptobacillus moniliformis<br>Spirillum minus<br>Leptospira interrogans<br>Yersinia pestis<br>Francisella tularensis<br>Borrelia burgdorferi|Streptobacillus moniliformis<br>Spirillum minus|Rationale: Rat-bite fever is a zoonotic disease caused by two different bacteria. The distractors are also causative agents of zoonotic diseases: Leptospirosis (<i>Leptospira</i>), Plague (<i>Yersinia</i>), Tularemia (<i>Francisella</i>), and Lyme disease (<i>Borrelia</i>).
```
"""

_SEED_CLOZE_PROMPT = """***

### ** PROMPT FOR CLOZE DELETION CARD CREATION**

**Objective:**
Create a targeted yet comprehensive set of cloze deletion cards covering the most high-yield aspects of the provided text. The goal is maximum coverage with minimum redundancy. Each card must test a single, specific, retrievable fact using Anki's {{c1::answer}} cloze syntax.

**Key Instructions:**

**1. Coverage & Priority:**
- Generate cards based on the following priority hierarchy:
    1.  Classification
    2.  Specific Drug/Substance Names
    3.  Mechanism of Action (MoA)
    4.  Therapeutic Uses
    5.  Adverse Effects
    6.  Common Names / Nicknames
    7.  Constituents
- Create cards about other unique, testable facts found in the text, even if they don't fit the categories above.
- Keep the card set lean. For reciprocal facts, prioritize the version that blanks the specific detail (name, mechanism, classification) rather than the broader category.
- Ignore exercises and sample problems in the source text.

**2. Cloze Syntax Rules (CRITICAL):**
- Use standard Anki cloze syntax: {{c1::answer}} for single blanks.
- Use numbered groups for related blanks on the same card: {{c1::first}} and {{c2::second}} — each cloze number tests independently.
- When multiple items belong to the same enumeration (e.g., a list of drug classes), use the SAME cloze number for all of them so they are tested together: {{c1::Drug A}}, {{c1::Drug B}}, {{c1::Drug C}}.
- Never put a hint inside the cloze unless it is essential for disambiguation: {{c1::answer::hint}} — use sparingly.
- A single card should not contain more than 3 distinct cloze deletions (c1, c2, c3 max).

**3. Text Phrasing:**
- Write the sentence in the Text column as a clean, factual statement — not a question.
- Avoid phrases like "According to the text," "from the provided text," etc.
- Avoid ambiguous pronouns such as "this," "that," or "it." Name the subject explicitly.
- The cloze text must make complete grammatical sense both with and without the blanks revealed.
- Use <b>, <i>, <u> HTML tags to emphasize non-blanked key terms in the Text column. Do NOT bold or italicize the cloze-deleted text itself.
- Image tags / references (if provided) are to be added at the bottom of the Extra column.

**4. AI Knowledge & Corrections:**
- Stay within the provided text for creating cards, but use broader knowledge to enrich the Extra column.
- Add a `Rationale:` to the Extra column whenever possible to provide context, mechanism, or clinical significance.
- If you identify a factual error in the source text, create the card using the corrected information. In the Extra column, note the correction (e.g., `Note: Source text stated [incorrect fact], which has been corrected to [correct fact].`).

**5. Formatting & Structure:**
- Use pipes `|` as separators.
- Output format per line: Subtopic|Text|Extra
- Skip the header row.
- Use HTML line breaks `<br>` for multi-line content within a column.
- Mnemonics go ONLY in the Extra column — never in the Text column.

**6. Examples:**

```
Anti-Diabetes|The biguanide drug withdrawn from the market due to a high risk of fatal <b>lactic acidosis</b> is {{c1::Phenformin}}.|Rationale: Phenformin carries a significantly higher risk of lactic acidosis than metformin due to its structure causing greater inhibition of mitochondrial respiration.<br><br>Note: Metformin, the remaining biguanide, has a much lower risk and remains first-line therapy.
Anti-Diabetes|<b>Insulin secretagogues</b> lower blood glucose by blocking {{c1::ATP-sensitive K+ channels}}, causing membrane {{c2::depolarization}} and subsequent insulin release.|Rationale: K+ channel blockade triggers Ca2+ influx via voltage-gated channels, which drives exocytosis of insulin granules from pancreatic β-cells.
Anti-Diabetes|Classes of drugs used for <b>diabetes mellitus</b> include {{c1::Biguanides}}, {{c1::Thiazolidinediones}}, {{c1::Alpha-glucosidase inhibitors}}, {{c1::SGLT2 Inhibitors}}, and {{c1::Amylin Analogues}}.|Rationale: These represent the major oral/injectable hypoglycemic drug classes beyond insulin.<br><br>Mnemonic: <b>I</b>n <b>B</b>right <b>T</b>imes, <b>A</b>ll <b>I</b>ndividuals <b>S</b>hine <b>A</b>gain.
Tannins|Plant sources notably rich in <b>tannins</b> include {{c1::Psidium guajava}} (Guava), {{c1::Hamamelis virginiana}} (Witch Hazel), {{c1::Quercus infectoria}} (Oak galls), and {{c1::Syzygium cumini}} (Java plum).|Rationale: These plants are exploited commercially for their astringent, antidiarrheal, and wound-healing properties derived from their high tannin content.
Sesame oil|The primary <b>antioxidant lignan</b> constituents of Sesamum indicum are {{c1::Sesamol}} and {{c1::Sesamolin}}.|Rationale: These lignans contribute significantly to the exceptional oxidative stability of sesame oil and have demonstrated free radical scavenging activity in vitro.
Zoonotic Diseases|<b>Rat-bite fever</b> is caused by either {{c1::Streptobacillus moniliformis}} or {{c1::Spirillum minus}}, depending on the geographic region.|Rationale: S. moniliformis predominates in North America (Haverhill fever), while S. minus is more common in Asia (Sodoku). Both are transmitted via rat bites or scratches.

"""

_SEED_BASIC_PROMPT = """***

### ** PROMPT FOR BASIC (FRONT/BACK) CARD CREATION**

**Objective:**
Create a targeted yet comprehensive set of Basic flashcards covering the most high-yield aspects of the provided text. Each card has a Front (the question or cue) and a Back (the Answer followed by the Rationale). The goal is maximum coverage with minimum redundancy.

**Key Instructions:**

**1. Coverage & Priority:**
- Generate cards based on the following priority hierarchy:
    1.  Classification
    2.  Specific Drug/Substance Names
    3.  Mechanism of Action (MoA)
    4.  Therapeutic Uses
    5.  Adverse Effects
    6.  Common Names / Nicknames
    7.  Constituents
- Create cards about other unique, testable facts found in the text, even if they don't fit the categories above.
- Keep the card set lean. For reciprocal facts, prioritize the version that cues with the broader category and answers with the specific detail.
- Ignore exercises and sample problems in the source text.

**2. Front (Question/Cue) Phrasing (CRITICAL):**
- Write the Front as a concise statement-cue or an incomplete sentence — not a full question with "What," "Which," "Where," "How," or "Why."
- Avoid phrases like "According to the text," "from the provided text," etc.
- Avoid ambiguous pronouns such as "this," "that," or "it." Name the subject explicitly.
- Use <b>, <i>, <u> HTML tags to emphasize the key tested concept on the Front.
- The Front must be specific enough that only one correct answer exists — avoid vague cues.
- Mnemonics must NEVER appear on the Front.

**3. Back (Answer & Rationale) Phrasing:**
- **Structure:** The Back must strictly follow this format: **[Direct Answer]** + `<br><br>` + **[Rationale]**.
- **The Direct Answer:**
    - Must come FIRST.
    - Must be the concise, minimal correct answer (no paragraph).
    - Use <b> to highlight key terms.
    - For lists, use <br> to separate items.
- **The Rationale:**
    - Must come SECOND (after the break).
    - Label it clearly with `Rationale:`.
    - Provide context, mechanism, or clinical significance here.
- Avoid restating the Front verbatim in the Back.

**4. AI Knowledge & Corrections:**
- Stay within the provided text for the *Direct Answer*, but use broader knowledge to enrich the *Rationale*.
- If you identify a factual error in the source text, provide the corrected fact in the Answer and explain the correction in the Rationale.
- Mnemonics should NOT go in the Rationale; put them in the **Extra** column.

**5. Formatting & Structure:**
- Use pipes `|` as separators.
- Output format per line: Subtopic|Front|Back|Extra
- Skip the header row.
- Use HTML line breaks `<br>` for multi-line content within a column.
- **Extra Column:** Use this column ONLY for Mnemonics and Images. If none exist, leave it empty.

**6. Examples:**

```
