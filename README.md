# Anki MCQ Importer - AI Batch Generator (v4.2.1)

An Anki add-on that batch-processes folders of study images with Google Gemini and creates high-yield cards into organized subdecks.

Version 4.2 expands profile flexibility while keeping prompts in runtime config (so edits survive add-on updates) and supports three built-in card formats:

- **MCQ** cards (Question / Multiple Choice / Correct Answers / Extra)
- **Cloze Deletion** cards (Text / Extra)
- **Basic** cards (Front / Back / Extra)

---

## What’s new in v4.2

### Config-based prompt persistence
- Built-in prompts are seeded once into config and preserved afterward.
- Prompt edits are no longer overwritten when updating the add-on.
- Missing built-in prompts/profiles are auto-backfilled non-destructively.

### Profile workflow improvements
- Added **New Blank Profile** flow with a format selector (**MCQ**, **Cloze**, or **Basic**).
- Duplicate profile workflow remains available for “copy and tweak”.
- Built-in profiles are protected from deletion and can be reset to factory prompt text.

### Multiple profiles for each prompt format
- You can now create and maintain **multiple prompt profiles per format** (MCQ, Cloze, and Basic).
- This allows separate profile variants (e.g., exam-style vs. concise-review) without overwriting your defaults.
- Active profile selection and per-profile field mapping are preserved per profile.

### Card-format support (including requested update)
- **Basic note types are supported** via the Basic profile and per-profile field mapping.
- **Cloze deletions are supported** via the Cloze profile parser and `{{c1::...}}` syntax guidance.
- Parser dispatch uses the active profile format (`mcq`, `cloze`, `basic`) at runtime.

## Core features

- Guided first-run setup and settings dialog.
- Gemini API key format checks and live connection tests.
- Dynamic model discovery from Gemini API (`generateContent`-capable models).
- Batch import workflow with progress tracking and summary reporting.
- Image validation with supported formats and max file-size checks.
- Context-aware generation support for page-to-page continuity.
- Automatic subdeck creation from parsed subtopics.
- Profile-specific prompt editing and per-profile field mapping.

## Prompt profile formats

### 1) MCQ profile
Expected output columns:

`Subtopic | Question | Multiple Choice | Correct Answers | Extra`

### 2) Cloze profile
Expected output columns:

`Subtopic | Text | Extra`

### 3) Basic profile

> Notes:
> - `Subtopic` is used for target subdeck naming.
> - `Extra` is used for rationale/mnemonics/additional context.
> - For multiline cell content, prompts use HTML `<br>` line breaks.

## Repository contents

- `__init__.py` — Main add-on implementation loaded by Anki.
- `config.json` — Packaged default config for fresh installs.
- `manifest.json` — Minimal Anki add-on metadata used for local `.ankiaddon` imports.
- `build.py` — Build script to create `.ankiaddon` packages.
- `README.md` — Project documentation.

---

## Build package

```bash
python build.py
```

The build script validates `manifest.json` before packaging so Anki receives the required top-level `package` and `name` metadata. On success, it generates:

- `anki_mcq_importer_ai_batch_generator_v<version>.ankiaddon`
- `RELEASE_NOTES_v<version>.md`

---

## Install in Anki (manual)

1. Build or download the `.ankiaddon` file.
2. In Anki, open **Tools → Add-ons → Install from file...**
3. Select the `.ankiaddon` file.
4. Restart Anki.
